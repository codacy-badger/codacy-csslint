Experimental CSS properties are typically implemented using vendor prefixes until the final behavior has been established
and agreed upon. Most CSS3 properties have vendor-prefixed equivalents for multiple vendors, including Firefox (`-moz`),
Safari/Chrome (`-webkit`), Opera (`-o`), and Internet Explorer (`-ms`).

It's easy to forget to include the vendor prefixed version of a property when there are so many to keep track of.
